                    <p class="who__blurb">Eddie is working on the role of the immune system in Parkinson’s disease progression. Specifically, Eddie
                        aims to determine if Parkinson’s disease is associated with T-cell recognition of specific epitopes
                        with the hope to explain the association of Parkinson's disease with specific human leukocyte antigen
                        complex alleles and whether immune modulation could help temper these maladaptive factors, enabling
                        beneficial immune responses in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. Eddie is also investigating
                        the epigenetic patterns that underlie healthy brain aging. Genome-wide studies have begun to characterize
                        epigenetic changes in neurodegenerative diseases and have led to an emerging realization that the
                        maintenance of a healthy brain relies in part on epigenetic mechanisms. His goal is to examine the
                        epigenetic underpinnings of the resistance to cognitive decline in subsets of elderly patients.
