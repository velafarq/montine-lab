              Dr. Montine received his education at Columbia University (BA in
              Chemistry), the University of Rochester (PhD in Pharmacology), and
              McGill University (MD and CM). His postgraduate medical training
              was at Duke University, and he was junior faculty at Vanderbilt
              University where he was awarded the Thorne Professorship in
              Pathology. In 2002, Dr. Montine was appointed as the Alvord
              Endowed Professor in Neuropathology and Director of the Division
              of Neuropathology at the University of Washington. He was Director
              of the University of Washington Alzheimer’s Disease Research
              Center, one of the original 10 Centers in the US, and passed that
              responsibility to able colleagues. In 2010, Dr. Montine was
              appointed Chair of the Department of Pathology at the University
              of Washington. In 2016, Dr. Montine was appointed Chair of the
              Department of Pathology at Stanford University where he is the
              Stanford Medicine Endowed Professor in Pathology.

              Dr. Montine is the founding Director of the Pacific Udall Center,
              one of 9 NINDS-funded Morris K. Udall Centers of Excellence for
              Parkinson’s Disease Research. Our center performs basic,
              translational, and clinical research focused on cognitive
              impairment in Parkinson’s disease. The Pacific Udall Center
              emphasizes a vision for precision health that comprises functional
              genomics, development of surveillance tools for pre-clinical
              detection, and discovery of molecularly tailored therapies.

              Dr. Montine is among the top recipients of NIH funding for all
              Department of Pathology faculty in the United States. He was the
              2015 President of the American Association of Neuropathologists,
              and led or co-led recent NIH initiatives to revise diagnostic
              guidelines for Alzheimer’s disease (NIA), develop research
              priorities for the National Alzheimer’s Plan (NINDS and NIA), and
              develop research priorities for Parkinson’s Disease (NINDS).

              The focus of the Montine Laboratory is on the structural and
              molecular bases of cognitive impairment with the goal of defining
              key pathogenic steps and thereby new therapeutic targets. The
              Montine Laboratory addresses these prevalent, unmet medical needs
              through a combination of neuropathology, biomarker development and
              application early in the course of disease, and experimental
              studies that test hypotheses concerning specific mechanisms of
              neuron injury and approaches to neuroprotection. PubMed lists 579
              publications for Dr. Montine. Google Scholar estimates Dr.
              Montine’s citations as > 38,000, his i-10 index as 355, and his
              H-Index as 98. NIH iCite calculates (1995 to 2017) Dr. Montine’s
              weighted relative citation ratio as 2041.

              Eddie is working on the role of the immune system in Parkinson’s
              disease progression. Specifically, Eddie aims to determine if
              Parkinson’s disease is associated with T-cell recognition of
              specific epitopes with the hope to explain the association of
              Parkinson's disease with specific human leukocyte antigen complex
              alleles and whether immune modulation could help temper these
              maladaptive factors, enabling beneficial immune responses in the
              context of neurodegenerative diseases. Eddie is also investigating
              the epigenetic patterns that underlie healthy brain aging.
              Genome-wide studies have begun to characterize epigenetic changes
              in neurodegenerative diseases and have led to an emerging
              realization that the maintenance of a healthy brain relies in part
              on epigenetic mechanisms. His goal is to examine the epigenetic
              underpinnings of the resistance to cognitive decline in subsets of
              elderly patients.

              Katie is interested in translational genomics using animals as
              models for human diseases. In collaboration with the James Lab,

              Parkinson’s disease and aims to improve early detection of using
              PET imaging. In collaboration with the Gomez-Ospina Lab, Katie is
              working on making a new mouse model for Gaucher’s disease and
              Parkinson’s disease using the CRISPR Cas9 system. This model will
              allow us to investigate stem cell therapy as a form of treatment
              for both diseases.

              designing novel antibiotics for the European gram-negative
              antibacterial engine (ENABLE) and UK Medical Research Council
